Grading Level:
    - Same grade for all members.

Differences:
    - We implemented an extra Tutorials Screen instead of the Reports feature because will will implement Reports as part of the Final Releaseâ€™s Test Transaction and Export features.
    -We are using standard iOS progress bars for OS visual consistency.
    -Per end user testing, we arranged the large dollar labels on the Budget Screen for readability and context.
    -The Tutorials screen is located on the tab bar instead of the settings menu because we will not implement the settings menu until the Final Release.
    -Per end user testing, the GoalsConfig Screen delete button was swapped with a Cancel button and the delete feature was moved to the Goals Screen for consistency across all screens.
    -Implemented responsive and contextual error messages that point out to the user where and what the error is.

Special Instructions:
    - None.
