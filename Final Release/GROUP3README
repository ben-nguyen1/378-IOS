Grading Level:
    - Same grade for all members.

Differences:
    - Test Transactions simply become 'Transacations', allowing users to enter a 1 time transcation (such as buying coffee) and keeping a record of all transactions
    - Replaced visuals with Export. We did not feel like we could implement what visuals could've been, so we went ahead and did the stretch goal of an export function.

Special Instructions:
    - None.
